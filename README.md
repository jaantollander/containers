Todo

- We should reduce image sizes and remove unnecessary files after builds.
- We reduce redundancies in dependencies
- We should manage external dependencies and move or mirror them under @permedcode GitHub team
- Containers should load specific dependencies from the @permedcoe GitHub team.
- We should install R packages with a script file rather than with inline commands.
- We will move the contents of this repository to @permedcode team when they are finished.
